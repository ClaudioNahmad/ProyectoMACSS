You will find in the [PresentacionCorta](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/ProyectoMACSS/tree/master/PresentacionCorta) 
directory the TEX and PDF for our first short presentation. 

The notebook for our [final presentation](https://github.com/FavioVazquez/ProyectoMACSS/blob/master/Final%20Presentation.ipynb)
uses CAMB so if you want to run it be sure that you have it installed. This is the official repo for PyCamb 
https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB.
